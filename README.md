# For 2023 NYCU introduction to ML Final Project

This repository is for my final project of the course in college. It is to solve a problem on Kaggle - [Tabular Playground Series - Aug 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-aug-2022/overview)

## Requirements

This repository use `pipenv` for dependency management. Make sure that `pipenv` has been install.

```setup
pipenv install
```

Then run the following command to activate the virtual enviroment shell

```shell
pipenv shell
```

Or you may also install the dependencies manually.

- `python` (`3.9` is recommended)
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

## Training

To train the model, run this command:

```train
python train.py
```

After that, a file named `model.pk` should be generated by default. It should store the trained model.

## Inference

To generate the prediction with a train, run this command:

```predict
python predict.py
```

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

## Results

The model achieves the following performance on :

- validation score (ROC): `0.6047459583156607`
- Public on Kaggle: `0.58601`
